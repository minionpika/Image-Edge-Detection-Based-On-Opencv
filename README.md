# Image-Edge-Detection-Based-On-Opencv

This is basically a full implementation of the paper "Image Edge Detection Based On Opencv" by Guobo Xie and Wen Lu.

It is very difficult for us to distinguish the exact number of the copper core in the tiny wire. A method of image edge detection is introduced to determine the exact number of the copper core in the tiny wire based on OpenCV with rich computer vision and image processing algorithms and functions.

For convenience folder description, process to run project are described in flow.pdf.
